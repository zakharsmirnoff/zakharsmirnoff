### Hi there 👋

My name is Zakhar! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Cloud / M365 engineer dealing with DevOps, deploying to clouds and troubleshooting cloud products
- ✍️ Sometimes I write something in my blog: https://dev.to/zakharsmirnoff
- 🤖 I have created a nice wrapper for OpenAI API, feel free to check this out: https://github.com/zakharsmirnoff/lloom
- 🌱 I’m eager to learn all things AI and interested especially in LLM, advocating for the use of GPT-4, Claude and other models!
